1.0.0 (6/20/2023)
-------------------
- Added angle reflexivities
    - Angle reflexivities may be used to generate relative positioning
    - Angle reflexivities are determined automatically when possible
        - Conjugate angles have opposite reflexivities
        - Angle measures imply reflexivities
        - At an intersection of two lines, the reflexivity of any angle formed at the intersection implies the reflexivity of the rest
- Added rays
    - Angles may be formed by two rays
- Added new theorems
- General bug fixes
- 99% test coverage
